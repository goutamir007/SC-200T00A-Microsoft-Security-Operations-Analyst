# Module 2 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

You start by initializing the Defender for Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices. You configure security for the environment. Lastly, you create Device groups and assign the appropriate devices.

>**Important:**  The lab Virtual Machines are used through different modules. SAVE your virtual machines. If you exit the lab without saving, you will be required to re-run some configurations again.


### Task 1: Initialize Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

In this task, you will perform the initialization of the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

1. On WIN1 Virtual machine, If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, start the Microsoft Edge browser.
