# Module 2 - Lab 1 - Exercise 2 - Mitigate Attacks with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

To explore the Defender for Endpoint attack mitigation capabilities, you will run two simulated attacks.


### Task 1: Simulated Attacks

In this task, you will run two simulated attacks to explore the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your Microsoft Edge browser, go to (https://security.microsoft.com) and login as ODL_USER_ID for your tenant.

1. From the menu, under **Endpoints**, select **Evaluation & tutorials** and then select **Tutorials & simulations** from the left side.

1. Select the **Tutorials** tab and under *Automated investigation (backdoor)*, click **Read the walkthrough**. A new browser tab opens which includes instructions to perform the simulation.

1. In the new browser tab, locate the section named **Run the simulation** and follow the steps in the **Run the Simulation** section to run the attack. The steps should include: (https://securitycenter.windows.com/tutorials) contain **Tutorials** tab, under **Automated investigation (backdoor)**, select **Get simulation file** to download the **RS4_WinATP-Intro-Invoice.docm** file. Continue to follow the steps till  from the browser tab to run the attack.

     **Note**: Open the document by using Microsoft Word.

1. Within the **Tutorials** tab also run the *Automated investigation (fileless attack)* by clicking **Read the walkthrough** and follow the steps in the **Run the simulation** section of the document.

1. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal select **Incidents & alerts** from the left menu bar, then select **Incidents**.

1. A new incident called "Multi-stage incident..." will appear in the right pane. Allow at least 5 minutes for the incident to appear. Click the incident name to load its details.

1. Select the **Manage incident** button and a new window blade appears. 

1. Under **Incident tags** type "Tutorial" and select **Tutorial (Create new)** to create a new tag. 

1. Select the toggle **Assign to me** to add your user account as owner of the incident. 

1. Under **Classification**, in the drop-down menu select **True alert**. 

1. Under **Determination**, in the drop-down menu select **Security test**. 

1. Add any comments if desired and click **Save** to finish.

1. Review the contents of the Alerts, Devices, Users, Investigations, Evidence and Response, Graph tabs. **Hint:** Some tabs might be hidden due the size of your display. Select the ellipsis tab (...) to make them appear.

>**Warning:** The simulations and tutorials here are an excellent source of learning through practice.  Simulations and tutorials are being added and edited regularly in the portal.  However, some of these simulations & tutorials may interfere with performance of the labs designed for this training course.  Only perform the simulations and tutorials recommended in the instructions provided for this lab when using the course provided Azure tenant.  You may perform the other simulations and tutorials *after* this training course is complete with this tenant.
