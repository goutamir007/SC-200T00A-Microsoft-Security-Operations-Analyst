# Module 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Explore Microsoft 365 Defender 

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft 365 Defender. You start by assigning preset security policies in EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

### Obtain Your Microsoft 365 Credentials

Once you launch the lab, a free trial tenant will be made available to you to access in the Microsoft virtual Lab environment. This tenant will be automatically assigned a unique username and password. You must retrieve this username and password so that you can sign in to Azure and Microsoft 365 within the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. 

Because this course can be offered by learning partners using any one of several Authorized Lab Hosting (ALH) providers, the actual steps involved to retrieve the tenant ID associated with your tenant may vary by lab hosting provider. Therefore, your instructor will provide you with the necessary instructions for how to retrieve this information for your course. The information that you should note for later use includes:

- **Tenant suffix ID.** This ID is for the onmicrosoft.com accounts that you will use to sign in to Microsoft 365 throughout the labs. This is in the format of **{username}@ZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant suffix ID provided by your lab hosting provider. Record this ZZZZZZ value for later use. When any of the lab steps direct you to sign in to Microsoft 365 portals, you must enter the ZZZZZZ value that you obtained here.
- **Tenant password.** This is the password for the admin account provided by your lab hosting provider.

### Create a Group 

1. On WIN1 Virtual machine, Navigate to Microsoft 365 Admin center (https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home)

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Username** provided in the environment details page (odl_user_DID@xxxxx.onmicrosoft.com) and then select Next.
